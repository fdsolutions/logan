## Introduction

This document provides to documentation, as complete as possible, of the software that is built here. It tries to give a good understanding of what is to be built and how is to be built. 

As a result, people, software developers or contributors we be able to catch the main purpose of this software, understand the philosophy behind the design and the implementation of the sofwtware. 

Thus, everyone will be able to easily contribute to the software whitout the fear of departing from the idea behind it.


## Motivation
As a software developer, we have to make a bit of application management. We are accountable of the well working of application in production. 

To monitor those applications, we use many different scripts and softwars to accomplish management  or monitoring tasks. Those scripts are often either internal or external and are  written in Bash, Python, Ruby or many other scripting languages. 

But, arrives the moment when you get full of scrpts and noone knows the purpose of each scritps. Even more, everybody makes copies of existing scripts, customizes them or simply renames them tha way they think it makes more sens.
